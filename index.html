                    <p>I'm seeking a career path in software programming because I find coding challenging and yet also exhilarating and addictive.  I’m always learning something new and love coming up with creative solutions to unprecedented issues. Also, the idea of building something from scratch and overcoming obstacles excites me. Enrolling in this program will allow me to further develop my skills and create a positive impact for society and women in tech. </p>
